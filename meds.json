Normally, bilirubin is removed from the blood by the liver and excreted in the bile. However, if the liver is not working properly, bilirubin can build up in the blood and cause jaundice.\n\nThere are several different types of jaundice, including:\n\n* **Neonatal jaundice:** This is the most common type of jaundice and occurs in about 60% of full-term babies and 80% of preterm babies. It is usually caused by a temporary immaturity of the liver and usually resolves on its own within a few days or weeks.\n* **Hepatitis:** This is an inflammation of the liver that can be caused by a virus, alcohol, or certain medications. Hepatitis can cause jaundice as well as other symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, and vomiting.\n* **Cholestasis:** This is a condition in which the flow of bile from the liver to the intestines is blocked. This can be caused by a number of factors, including gallstones, tumors, and certain medications. Cholestasis can cause jaundice as well as other symptoms such as itching, pale stools, and dark urine.\n\nThere is no specific medicine for jaundice. Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the jaundice. For example, if the jaundice is caused by hepatitis, the treatment will focus on treating the hepatitis. If the jaundice is caused by cholestasis, the treatment will focus on treating the cause of the cholestasis.\n\nIn some cases, light therapy may be used to treat jaundice. Light therapy works by breaking down bilirubin in the skin. This can help to lower the levels of bilirubin in the blood and reduce the symptoms of jaundice.\n\nIf you are concerned about jaundice, it is important to see a doctor. The doctor will be able to diagnose the cause of the jaundice and recommend the best course of treatment."
